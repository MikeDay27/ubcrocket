          <p class="text-muted">The private space company tested its Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time Tuesday by sending a Tesla Roadster out into space. The successful return of two of the three boosters is an exciting event for the next generation of scientists.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">They may not be building the rocket itself, but they are making what the rocket will carry.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">Together with physics, astronomy and science research teacher Carl Savage, the students are building an experiment to be fired 10,000 feet up in a UBC student-made rocket during an international competition in 2018.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">The school got the invite to be part of the UBC Rocket project through former BSS student Gibson Clark, who’s now on the UBC Rocket team, said Savage."</p>

          <p class="text-muted">"A Summerland Secondary School graduate was part of a winning team in a recent rocket competition in New Mexico.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">Simon Bambey, a second-year student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, was one of the founders of UBC Rocket, one of more than 110 post-secondary teams from 11 countries competing in the Spaceport America Cup.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">The team consisted of 60 active student members who worked from September to June designing and building the rocket.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">'We designed and built everything,' Bambey said."</p>

          <p class="text-muted">"A year ago, no one imagined that a team of amateurs from UBC would successfully send their rocket, Cypress, to an altitude of 10,000 feet. No one imagined the amount of time and energy that the team would dedicate to flying a rocket to suborbital space. Above all, no one imagined that this team of underdogs would win their first rocket launch competition.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">But with a little luck and a lot of hard work, UBC Rocket did just that.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">From June 20 to 24, the UBC Rocket Team competed at the Spaceport American Cup in Las Cruces, New Mexico where 110 student teams from around the world launched rockets to altitudes of 10,000 and 30,000 feet."</p>
