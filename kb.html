More generally, any rocket, orbital or suborbital, has the purpose of accelerating a payload to somewhere high and/or fast. Thus, the purpose is dependent on the payload. Our team like to maximize the usefulness of the rocket by considering as many payload options as possible, as well as enable multiple payloads to be attached.</td>

For this, parachutes are typically used, and this process is known as recovery. <a href="https://www.apogeerockets.com/Intro_to_Dual_Deployment_in_Rocketry">Click here to learn more.</a></td>
